 Login System ðŸ“±

## Introducion
- I made this to learn how to make a login system using hashing.
- It has the ability to register users with username and password.
- Password is hashed and stored in userDatabase.
- It verifies that the username and password exists by comparing it to the stored hash.
- 3 options available to user : 1.Register, 2.Login, 3.Exit.
